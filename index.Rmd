# Introduction

The purpose of this project is performing financial analysis on private company data. 
This project was chosen for personal reason. My grandfather was escaped from communist
North Korea during Korean civil war, while left all his family on North.
After settling down in South Korea, he had started his business outskirts of Seoul city.
While there was ups and downs, luckily business have survived in few decades and grown its size.
Now my grandfather is 93 years old and he is suffering from bad health condition. 
As a third generation, I thought it would be meaningful to follow his legacy and visualize company
data in timely manner and do some financial analysis. To give more explanation, visualization of 
financial data from consolidated financial statements in 20 years was done firstly. Then, various
indexes were presented to figure out how company has performed and what is weakness/opportunity. 
Next, stock data was presented with some indexes.It was also compared with price of imported
minerals(nickel) to see if there is any association between stock price and mineral price. 
Company is publicly listed company in Korea stock exchange(KOSPI, code: 032560)
