This project was chosen for personal reason. My grandfather was escaped from communist North Korea during Korean civil war, while left all his family on North. After settling down in South Korea, he had started his business outskirts of Seoul city. While there was ups and downs, luckily business have survived in few decades and grown its size. Now my grandfather is 93 years old and he is suffering from bad health condition. As a third generation, I thought it would be meaningful to follow his legacy and visualize company data in timely manner and do some financial analysis. To give more explanation, visualization of financial data from consolidated financial statements in 20 years was done firstly. Then, various indexes were presented to figure out how company has performed and what is weakness/opportunity. Next, stock data was presented with some indexes.It was also compared with price of imported minerals(nickel) to see if there is any association between stock price and mineral price. Company is publicly listed company in Korea stock exchange(KOSPI, code: 032560) test "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.0.1 Financial Data Financial data was collected from DART(Data Analysis, Retrieval and Transfer System) which is managed by government agency, Financial Supervisory Service.

Individual financial statements were presented, but it was messy and hard to combine as well. To handle missing data, it was simply estimated by the difference between 2006 and 2009 data. For 2007, it was estimated Data2007 = Data2006 + (Data2009 - Data2006)/3 For 2008, Data2008 = Data2006 + (Data2009 - Data2006)*(2/3) It was also observed that nickel data was collected in timely manner, but some was omitted. In order to plot the nickel vs stock data, inner join was used between stock data and nickel data.
