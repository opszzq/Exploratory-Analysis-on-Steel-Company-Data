This project was chosen for personal reason. My grandfather was escaped from communist North Korea during Korean civil war, while left all his family on North. After settling down in South Korea, he had started his business outskirts of Seoul city. While there was ups and downs, luckily business have survived in few decades and grown its size. Now my grandfather is 93 years old and he is suffering from bad health condition. As a third generation, I thought it would be meaningful to follow his legacy and visualize company data in timely manner and do some financial analysis. To give more explanation, visualization of financial data from consolidated financial statements in 20 years was done firstly. Then, various financial indexes were presented to figure out how company has performed and what is companies’ weakness and opportunities. Stock data was presented with some indexes. Stock data was also compared with price of imported minerals(nickel) to see if there is any association between stock price and mineral price. To give some information about company, company is publicly listed company in Korea stock exchange(KOSPI, code: 032560). Company consists of two business domain: one is manufacturing steel product, and the other is construction.

In Korea, all publicly listed companies and private companies who have certain amount of total asset are obligated to disclose quarterly and yearly financial information through this system. In DART, it also provides open API and python package(“DART_FSS”) for users to collect yearly data. Note that web address for DART is (https://dart.fss.or.kr/) 2.2 Stock Data Stock data was collected from “finance naver” which is largest and one of the most popular search engine in Korea. Web address for finance naver is (https://finance.naver.com/) 2.3 Nickel Data Nickel data can be directly downloaded into csv or xlsx format from KORES, which is government agency controlling natural resources(Korea Resoruces Corporation). Web address for KORES is (https://www.kores.net/komis/) "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Financial Data 3.2 Stock Data 3.3 Nickel Data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Financial Data As briefly explained from part 2, data acquisition of company financial data was done by python package. It was saved in xlsx format and can be imported as data frame format in R library. Code for the financial data acquisition is represented below. #dart_fss package import dart_fss as dart # get api_key to access to database api_key =&#39;private_api_from_user&#39; dart.set_api_key(api_key=api_key) # reference consolidate financial data crp_list = dart.get_corp_list() hwangkum = crp_list.find_by_corp_code(&#39;032560&#39;) # set begin date to collect data from begin date fs= dart.fs.extract(corp_code = &#39;032560&#39;, bgn_de = &#39;19990101&#39;) # save it in local directory fs.save() 3.2 Stock Data Same as financial data acquisition, stock data were crawled from web through below code and saved as csv format. It can be imported as data farme in R as well.

Below is the link for the nickel data. (https://www.kores.net/komis/price/mineralprice/basemetals/pricetrend/baseMetals.do) "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Handle missing values in financial data 4.2 Handle missing values in mineral data(nickel)", " Chapter 4 Missing values Since data sources are came from government agency, most of data were in complete form with a little missing data. However, there are no data present before 1999 since the company was not listed at that time nor total asset was not reached to the certain level. Also, some of categories(e.g., non-current assets) were not presented in old data(1999 - 2005). However, such detailed data were redundant for this project. Below is the process how the missing data were handled in this project. 4.1 Handle missing values in financial data While collecting consolidated financial data, it was observed that year 2007 and 2008 were totally omitted and left as blank. Individual financial statements were presented, but it was messy and hard to combine as well. To handle missing data, it was simply estimated by the difference between 2006 and 2009 data. For 2007, it was estimated Data2007 = Data2006 + (Data2009 - Data2006)/3 For 2008, Data2008 = Data2006 + (Data2009 - Data2006)*(2/3) 4.2 Handle missing values in mineral data(nickel) It was also observed that nickel data was collected in timely manner, but some was omitted. In order to plot the nickel vs stock data, inner join was used between stock data and nickel data. Since stock data consists of full data without missing one, performing inner join would leave data frame same row-length(where date was presented) with combined nickel - stock data.

As observed from above figure, company has performed and managed its risk fairly well since equity has been always larger than liability after publicly listed. Equity to liability also expressed in bar graph in second figure. From this bar graph, it can be assumed that leverage of the company has fairly managed. Detailed analysis in leverage is presented in later paragraph. Note that 1000 Won is roughly equal to 0.9 USD. 5.2 Yearly Trend in Revenue, Gross Profit and Profit Yearly trend in company revenue, gross profit and sales is presented in above figure. It can be observed that from 2003 to 2015, regardless of the sharp growth in sales(revenue), gross profit and profit is almost flat and didn’t increase much. This is mainly due to increase in cost of sales. As observed in above graph, cost of sales has same trend with revenue(sales) and makes profit doesn’t necessarily have positive relationship with revenue. In manufacturing business, cost of raw material is crucial factor to determine both revenue and profit. Thus, it is important to buy raw material cheaper as possible. It was later interviewed from company manager that company set various strategies to buy raw material in lowest price as possible. However, raw material(especially stainless steel) price varies with various factors, from political matters to geographical difference. For example, anti-dumping law would put additional imported taxes which makes increase in raw material price. Production stop in nickel mine in Indonesia due to increase in spread of COVID-19 has become a factor increasing raw material price as well. From 2015 - 2020, revenue and profit has increased. Expansion of business sector to construction business majorly contributed increase in revenue and relative less increase in cost of sales(compared to previous history). Since steal beam is one of fundamental material in construction business, company has been able to obtain price competitiveness. 5.3 Company Revenue based on product proportion Above pie chart show company’s revenue based on proportion of sales category. Roughly 65 % of company’s revenue consists of steel-based product and 32 % consists of construction. It also shows that company doesn’t involve in any export business. This is due to high labor cost and less price competency in global market. 5.4 Profitability Indicator Above shows four histograms which indicate company profitability. First one is return on asset(ROA) which is indicator of how profitable the company is relative to its total asset. Second one is return on equity(ROE) which indicates the interest return of the capital supplied by the shareholder. Third one is operating margin, which indicates how company is efficient in its operations and is good at turning sales into profits. Similar to third one, fourth one is return on sales(ROS), which also indicates how company is efficient in its operation and turning sales into profits. Only difference between operating margin and ROS is calculation of operation margin involves operation profit(revenue less operating expenses), while calculation of ROS involves net profit(operation profit less non-operation expenses). Unlike 2000 to 2010, through 2010 to 2020, company’s ROA always has been less than 7.5%. This means company’s asset has grown but business has been steady or slightly increase in its net income. Company finds breakthrough after 2015 by adding construction business as a new sector. ROE shows much higher percentage than ROA. This means business is operated in conservative and steady(less debt). From 2010 to 2020, ROS has been varies roughly between 3 % to 12 %. While 3 % is also moderate return on sale considering company’s size and characteristic of manufacturing business, 12 % in 2019 is impressive. However, due to nature of construction business, revenue of construction business is heavily rely on project bidding. Thus, it is important to invest in R&amp;D to develop more technology and seek new business area comes with higher profitability. 5.5 Debt Repayment Ability Indicator Above shows current-ratio, quick ratio and debt-equity ratio of company. Current ratio indicates company’s ability to pay short-term obligations within one year. Quick ratio is more conservative way to indicate company’s ability to pay short-term debts(It doesn’t count inventory assets since inventory assets are generally regarded as “hard” to sell). Both current ratio and quick ratio have been managed fairly well, since it have always been higher than 100 % through whole year. Debt-equity ratio also has been kept near 60 %, meaning that company has been operated conservatively and steadily. 5.6 Stock Price Analysis Above shows company stock vs nickel price trend and yearly-based box plot of company stock price. Nowadays nickel price has been a hot potato due to electric car battery, but before then it has been a crucial factor to steel manufacturing company since nickel is most expensive component in stainless steel and played as most important role while determining stainless steel price. It is not perfectly correlated, but in general it can be observed and nickel and company stock price follows similar trend. Stock prices reached its peak from 2008, when nickel price reached to its peak. Furthermore, through 2008 to 2009, company added pipe line factory as its subsidiaries, gave more impact on varying its stock price. However in recent 10 years, company’s stock price has not varied much and decrease in its trend. Due to the nature of manufacturing business in Korea, it is steady business but there is not much room to improve its performance. Furthermore, business itself already reached to red ocean and market price of steel-based product is also controlled by monopoly(POSCO).

ROA ROE ROS .axisBlue text{ fill: steelblue; } .axisGreen text{ fill: #D2F2C2; } "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In 5, visualization and analysis of company data was done in various manners. Company has its strength in its capital power where company has been operated conservatively, while keep good equity to debt ratio. Furthermore, since manufacturing and construction business are regarded as “Steady” business sector, There will be less room for company to drastically decrease in its sales(and profit). However, steel and manufacturing business has become red ocean and competition between steel companies has become intense. Moreover, due to the nature of steel business, it is heavily rely on the price of mineral. Construction business is also operated based on bidding, so portfolio management and R&amp;D is crucial. In terms of opportunity, Since 72.1 % of Korea consists of mountainous district, there will be further expansion in clearing mountain. Growth in population would be a factor for active city construction as well. I believe construction business will play major role in this process. Though it is impossible to predict accurately when it will happen, but if union of North Korea and South Korea comes true, both steel and construction business will be booming. To conclude, I believe company should focus on finding future business and invest more on high-profitable business to have competency in future. But at the same time, company has to put effort on maintaining its market capitalization in both steel and construction business. "]]
