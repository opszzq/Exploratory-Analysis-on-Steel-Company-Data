### Handling missing Data

While collecting consolidated financial data, it was observed that year 2007
and 2008 were totally omitted and left as blank. Individual financial statements
were presented, but it was messy and hard to combine as well. To handle missing data,
it was simply estimated by the difference between 2006 and 2009 data. 
For 2007, it was estimated Data2007 = Data2006 +  (Data2009 - Data2006)/3
For 2008, Data2008 = Data2006 + (Data2009 - Data2006)*(2/3)

It was also observed that nickel data was collected in timely manner, but some 
was omitted. In order to plot the nickel vs stock data, inner join was used between
stock data and nickel data.
